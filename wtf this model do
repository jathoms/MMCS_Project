the model does

in essence, the model works to minimise:
    the sum over each time period of:
        the L1-norm of a vector X 
            such that X_i = S_i - D_i
                S_i energy supply for region i, 
                D_i = energy demand of region i
                    for i in {0..n} 
                        where n in the number of regions.
